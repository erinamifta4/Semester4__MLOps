# case - credit card risk model
Probability to default model build to fulfill business expectation of optimum default rate on their credit card portfolio. The project structured to have apple-to-apple comparison from the machine learning methods and we would see which model will be choosed as the final model by considering the pros and cons of each presented model

## Background
- Expected 2.5% of default rate for incoming credit card application
- Availability of data to measure the behavior of recent credit card customer

## Goal
- Build a credit risk model for scoring
- Determine the cutoff score for approveand reject boundaries

## File/folder dictionary
- ia_pkg : function set to do the whole work
- LR and XGB_credit_card_model.ipynb : the main playground to do the model building, including analysis of the dataset and cutoff score
- credit_ds_v3.csv : Dataset used, mainly consist of behavioral information towards credit card
- Data Glossary v3.xlsx : Dataset metadata
